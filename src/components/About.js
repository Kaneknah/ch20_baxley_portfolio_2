				{" "}
				I am a former High School teacher who has recently transitioned to web
				design. Born and raised in San Diego, I attended San Diego State
				University for my BA in History. I also acquired a Masters in Education
				from Azusa Pacific University and a Clear Teaching Credential from
				University of California San Diego. I have been in the Educational Field
				in California and Montana for over 12 years, before I decided to change
				directions and pursue a career in web design. I have
				completed the Berkely Bootcamp in Full Stack Web Development in April
				and have provided several examples of my completed projects through that
				course. I have also provided some of my own projects that I have
				completed on my own. I currently live outside of Missoula Montana with
				my beautiful wife and my three daughters and son. I am very excited to
				combined my professional knowledge with my newly learned skills to dive
				into an engaging career in web design{" "}
